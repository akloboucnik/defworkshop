;; # Conditionals
;;
;; Conditionals are control structures that make certain blocks of code executed or omitted from
;; execution under certain conditions. For exmaple, with `if` block, you only want the truthy block
;; to be evaluated, and for `when` you only want an entire expression to be evaluated only if
;; condition is true.
